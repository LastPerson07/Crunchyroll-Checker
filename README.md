## ❓ FAQ

**Is it safe from Antivirus?**
Yes. Packaged Python EXEs can trigger false positives, but it is completely safe.

**Do I need proxies?**
Yes, you need proxies. Crunchyroll rate-limits direct IPs very quickly.

**What proxy formats work?**
`ip:port`, `user:pass@ip:port`, and `socks5://ip:port`. Both HTTP and HTTPS are supported.

**The GUI window doesn't open / crashes on launch?**
Ensure your antivirus isn't automatically blocking the background process, or try running the application as an Administrator.
